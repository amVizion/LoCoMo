*Objective*: Implement the most basic RAG memory.

1. Store embeddings for conversations, and questions.
2. Find the most similar dialogue question in memory.
3. Measure if the answer is in the top 10, and the average distance to the question.
4. Connect response to ollama, and implement web app to demonstrate the RAG.
5. Visualize questions & answers in 2D.


## Next Steps
1. Iterative Inference.
